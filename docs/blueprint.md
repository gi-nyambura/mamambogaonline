## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, desaturated emerald green (#50C878) to represent freshness and growth, in alignment with the agricultural theme, but with a modern, muted twist. Using a desaturated shade ensures it's not overpowering.
- Background color: Light, off-white (#F8F8F8), almost the same hue as the primary but desaturated for a clean, spacious feel.
- Accent color: Warm tan color (#CD661D), analogous to green and evocative of clay, selected to offer a natural and inviting contrast to the primary and background.
- Poppins font for headings.
- Inter font for content.
- Illustrated icons related to fresh produce and market activities.
- Subtle micro-animations on the "For You" page during product loading and updates, as well as a "Pick Your Basket" animation when adding to cart and a "Farm to You" order tracking timeline.
